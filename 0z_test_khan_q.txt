A neurologist is testing the effect of a drug on response time by injecting 100 rats with 
a unit of dose of the drug, subjecting each to neurological stimulus and recording its 
response time. The neurologist knows that the mean response time for rats not injected with the
drug is 1.2 seconds. The mean of the 100 injected rats response time is 1.05 seconds with the sample standard
deviation of 0.5 seconds. Do you think that the drug has an affect on response time?
